1. If we change the "Gemfile", then we need to run the following command in the project home directory again:
bundle install

2. config/application.rb
-----------
In MySQL -> root user do the following:

CREATE DATABASE simple_cms_development;

CREATE DATABASE simple_cms_test;

for production:
CREATE DATABASE simple_cms_production; (only for production not for development)
-------------
Don't use root user for the application, instead create root user:

So create a new user:
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON simple_cms_development.* TO 'rails_user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'secretepassword';

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON simple_cms_development.* TO 'rails_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'secretepassword'; (if doing development from localhost)

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON simple_cms_test.* TO 'rails_user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'secretepassword';

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON simple_cms_test.* TO 'rails_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'secretepassword'; (if doing development from localhost)

---------------
Configure the database.yml file

rails db:schema:dump
